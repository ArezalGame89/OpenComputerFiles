# OpenComputer FILES
This repository is the hosting hub for my `OpenComputer` Mod files, [OpenComputer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencomputers) is a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us)
mod that adds interactive Lua computers
## Why?
Why you ask?, well, i got interested that OpenOS had [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) and curl **AND** because pastebin wouldn't work

So i wanted to expirment around with Lua and The OSes made with it
